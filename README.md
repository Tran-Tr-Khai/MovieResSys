# Moives Recommendation System

## Description

The **Movies Recommendation System** is a web-based application built using **Streamlit**. This system utilizes a **content-based recommendation algorithm** to suggest similar movies based on their metadata, such as **movie descriptions**, **actors**, **directors**, **release date**, and **genres**. The core of the recommendation system is based on **cosine similarity**, which compares movies based on their textual features to find the most similar movies.

The system allows users to select a movie, and in return, it will suggest movies that are similar based on content attributes.

## Dataset
- **TMDb API**: [TMDb API Documentation](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)


## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: A Python framework for creating web apps.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing the **TF-IDF** vectorizer and calculating **cosine similarity**.
- **Pandas**: For handling and processing movie data.
- **Numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (Optional): For any visualizations.
